The fonts is8859-*-8x* are obtained from the isofonts package
by Kosta Kostis <kosta@blues.sub.de> who seems to have
rearranged materials from the PC code pages collected by Yossi Gil.

The fonts cp*thn-* come from DOS 5.02 code pages labelled ISO.CPI,
the ISO referring not to iso646 nor iso8859 nor iso10646, but rather
to some obscure iso ergonomic standard.
The cp???alt-* fonts are also DOS 5.02, but differ from the corresponding
plain cp???-* fonts by minor editing of the glyphs.  I could not tell
which was better/newer.

The lucidQ??-* fonts are just like the lucida??-* fonts, which are
lucida typewriter, but the Q means that the backquote '`' was
turned upside down to match expectations of computer users.
In the smallest sizes, the rightquote '\'' had to be made
asymmetric about the vertical axis, and the 'M' edited
for legibility because it appeared to have smeared.

The is8859* fonts seem to have been formed by rearranging
dos cpi fonts into the iso standard encodings.
The control chars got glyphs with two chars joined,
reflecting the two-char mnemonics for the control function:
NU for Null, ET for EndofTeXt, etc.

The wgreek font came from the is8859-7-8x16 font with added
diacriticals.  An extra line of height was needed to make the
diacriticals legible, a line of width to relieve crowding
caused by the extra info.  The encoding of the chars
reflects that of the greek fonts in the WINGREEK shareware package.

The gacha-* and gachabold-* fonts came from screen fonts in a
Sun /usr/lib/fonts/fixedwidthfonts directory.  Likewise the apl-8x10 font.

The following 33 fonts were found (in vga format) among other fonts
in the QB/EVGFX package, ftp-able as qbevgfx3.zip on oak.oakland.edu .

thincaps-8x14 came from the nvltfnts.zip package on oak.oakland.edu
and is cleaned up after coming from fntcol15.

Several fonts came from oak.oakland.edu:pub/msdos/vga/fontpak.zip v1.0
from  Tim Sneath <tjs@cs.nott.ac.uk>.  I removed the standard vga glyphs
from below 32 and above 128, as they didn't fit in with the rest of the font.
These are   antique-8x16, broadway-8x16, greekthin-8x16,
	    medieval-8x16, roman2-8x16, script-8x16 .

Taken from the linux package kbd_fonts.tar.gz with no provenance:
     sansfbold-8x15	A Latin1 font, bold, sanserif.

From the same package attributed to VFONT:
     
     romanlarg-8x16	A taller version of Roman, complete with varying
			character line widths, serifs, and numbers that are
			non-lining (i.e. extend below the baseline).
     muchery-8x16	Muchery (TM) a wide, san-serif font.
     mucherylg-8x16	Muchery Large, a taller version of Muchery.
     tektite-8x16	Tektite, an "Architect" style font.
     clouds-8x16	Clouds, a tall hybrid font.
     blockx-8x16	Blockx, a very large and bold san-serif font.
     moderne-8x16	Moderne, a highly stylized art-deco/moderne font.
     modernerd-8x16	Moderne Round, a rounded version of Moderne.
			moderne is close to "art" and "wiggly" in fntcol15.
     scrawl-8x16	Scrawl, a handwritten-looking "scrawled" font, an
			extensively re-worked version of a public-domain font
			(which had no name).   With the added attraction of
			scrawled, wiggly line-drawing characters!

These 9 fonts were taken from version 5.10 of the DOS - OS/2 program called
"vfont". It can be found via anon ftp on many sites as "vfont2.zip" which
is 29312 bytes. In this version of the program, the fonts are seperated
from the DOS "vfont.com" program, and hence are easy to recover in a 
Linux useable format. They are stored as 13 consecutive 4096 byte font
records in the file "vfont.dat".
[Also from version 4.36]

CHAREDIT version 0.91 of 1991 by H. Peter Anvin
(found on eecs.nwu.edu in ched091.zip)
contained these five fonts in another format.
square-8x14		boxy-shaped in cp437-encoding
square-8x8
cp437-8x6		very short glyphs
cp437-8x7
nonlatin1-8x14		from multilng, much miscellaneous stuff not in Latin1

In LQ version 2.0 in the PC-blue volume 328 on oak.oakland.edu
epson printer fonts including the following were found in a
different format.  The filenames were adjusted to say
fooO, not fooital, fooB, not foo2, etc.
The epson aspect ratio would print these 10x24 rasters in a box
of shape 9x24, but they already look tall and thin enough as is.

The package includes an edchar.exe font editor for that format of font.
My lq2mgr.c filter converts the font formats to mgr.

These fonts were found in the Bradford v2.0 font printing package
on oak.oakland.edu in the PC-Blue collection, volume #?.
The side/bottom bearings I added semi-automatically myself,
the spacing not being obviously present in the original.

The apeaus-8x1[46] fonts were upgraded from
//oak.oakland.edu/pub/msdos/screen/apeaus20.zip from B.SEHARI1@GENIE.GEIS.COM .

The fonts calligraf-8x14 and x16 were taken from a cp437 font collection
named xfonts-ibmpc.tar.gz in the Linux archive.
There they were called "script".
The source of this package was Mike Batchelor of Quarterdeck Office Systems,
email: mikebat@gdeck.com

The betagreek-8x16 font was derived from GRroman-8x16 by V Broman,
where upper case latin letters were replaced by uncial greek
letters encoded according to the TLG/CCAT Beta scheme.
