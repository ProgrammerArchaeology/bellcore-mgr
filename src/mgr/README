This is the MGR server, the result of merging the old Linux server with
Stephen Uhler's last private version which was never released to the
net, plus debugging and rewriting some smaller parts.  It also contains
a patch for bold and underlined text from Stephen Uhler which he never released,
plus uncounted amounts of bug fixes and patches.
