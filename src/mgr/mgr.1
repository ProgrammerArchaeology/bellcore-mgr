.\"{{{  Description
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*M
is a graphics window manager.  It permits the creation and manipulation
of overlapping windows, with different processes running in each window.
The user controls the function and layout of the display with a mouse.
Windows are updated asynchronously even if they are partially (or
completely) obscured by other windows, although obscured windows may
arrange to have their output suspended until the window is uncovered.
.LP
Each window runs a terminal emulator which, in addition to the functions
normally required to run screen oriented programs, such as \fIvi(1)\fP,
provides primitives for drawing lines, doing
.I bit-blts,
and performing administrative functions such as 
.I reshaping
the window,
changing
.I fonts,
or
starting a new window.
Details of the terminal emulator operation are described in
the \*M - C Language Application Interface.
.LP
.\"{{{  Startup file format
.SS "Startup file format"
Upon invocation
\*M
reads commands from the "startup file",
.B $HOME/.mgrc
(see 
.B \-s
flag above)
to initialize the display.
Commands are placed one per line with the command arguments separated
by spaces or tabs.
The following commands are supported:
.LP
.TP
\fBinitcmd\fP \fIcommand\fP [ \fIargs...\fP ]
This command line is handed to the shell and executed
at the time the startup file is read.
.TP
\fBsuspendcmd\fP \fIcommand\fP [ \fIargs...\fP ]
This command line is handed to the shell and executed
each time \*M suspends it self,
either due to a main menu selection or the Left-z key.
.TP
\fBresumecmd\fP \fIcommand\fP [ \fIargs...\fP ]
This command line is handed to the shell and executed
each time \*M resumes after a suspension.
.TP
\fBquitcmd\fP \fIcommand\fP [ \fIargs...\fP ]
This command line is handed to the shell and executed
just before \*M quits,
either due to a main menu selection or the Left-Q key.
.TP
\fBcolors \fIn0 n1 n2 n3\fP
This changes the colors used in the system menu and the screen background.
The foreground and background colors in the system (left mouse button) menu are
.I n0
and
.I n1
while the screen background pattern combines colors
.I n2
and
.I n3.
.TP
\fBslide \fIdx dy\fP
This changes the screen offset of a child menu from a parent menu
from the default of 40, 10 pixels.
.TP
\fBpage \fIdx dy\fP
This changes the screen offset between the parts of paged menus
from the default of 5, -5 pixels.
.TP
\fBmap\fP \fIn0 n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 n7\fP
This changes the meaning of the mouse buttons.
Each
.I n[0-7]
represents one of the 8 states of the three
.I mouse buttons.
The default mapping is: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.  To change the meaning of the
.I left
and
.I right
buttons, 0 4 2 6 1 5 3 7 would be used(L=1,M=2,R=4).
It is possible to map a button
out of existence, which may have grave consequences.
.TP
\fBfont\fP \fIfont_number font_name\fP
The default font may be overridden by specifying the font
.I font name
which is to be substituted for the font at position
.IR font_number .
Font numbers
are small integers, in the range of 0-99.
The
.IR font_name s
are found in the font directory, by default
.BR /usr/mgr/font .
See the
.B \-f
flag above.
.TP
\fBwindow\fP \fIx y wide high\fP [ \fIfont_number\fP ]
A window is created whose corner is at the coordinates
.I (x, y)
and whose size is
.I (wide, high).
Units are in pixels, with 
.I x
and
.I y
increasing to the 
.I right
and
.I
down
respectively.
.I Wide
and
.I high
can be set in terms of characters in the current font by appending
the letter "c" to the value.
If
.I x
and
.I y
are
.BR \-1 ,
then they are replaced by values that causes new windows to
"tile" across the screen.
Setting
.I wide
and
.I high
to
.B \-1
is identical to setting them to "80c" and "24c" respectively.
The scope of the
.B window
command continues until either another 
.B window
command or
.B done
is reached.
The rest of the options,
.B shell, start, init,
.B flags,
and
.B newwindow
apply only to the current
.B window
command.
.RS
.TP
\fBshell\fP \fIcommand\fP [ \fIargs...\fP ]
.I Command
is the name of the command or shell to be started in the window.
If
.I command 
is not specified, then the environment variable
.B $SHELL,
or 
.B /bin/csh
is used.
.TP
\fBactive \fP
This window will be active.
.TP
\fBwindowsetid \fIi0\fP
Specifies the setid of the window must be
.I i0.
.TP
\fBstart\fP \fIcommand\fP
The
.I command 
is sent to the 
.I shell
upon startup, as if it had
been typed at the keyboard.
.TP
\fBinit\fP \fIinitial_string\fP
The 
.I
initial string
is sent to the 
.I window
upon startup.
The string is terminated by white space, the remainder of the
line may be used as a comment.
The codes:
.B \e\e, \eb, \ef \ee, \en, \er, \eMx
or
.B \es
may be used to represent
.I \e, backspace formfeed, escape, newline, return, x|0200,
or
.I space
respectively.
.TP
\fBflags\fP \fIflag...\fP
Normally a window self destructs when the original process running in it dies.
if
.I nokill
is specified, the window hangs around until specifically snuffed by
the user.
The
.I background
flag sets a condition which is presently a default anyway,
that this window when non-active will be updated continuously,
without waiting for it to be raised.
The
.I expose
flag requests that this window be exposed, or moved in front
of the other windows, as soon as it has something to output.
.TP
.B newwindow
The current window specification is not to be used to initialize the display,
but instead will be used when
.B "Left n"
or
.B "Right n"
to create a new window.
.RE
.TP
.B done
.B done
must be the last line in the startup file if any
.B window
commands are specified, or the last
.B window
command will not take affect.
.\"}}}
.\"{{{  Using the mouse
.SS "Using the mouse"
User interaction with 
\*M
is with the mouse.
Moving the mouse causes a corresponding movement of the 
.I mouse cursor,
usually an arrow pointing to the upper left.
The
.I left
or
.I command button
of mouse activates a
.I menu
whose options depend upon the current mouse position.
An option is chosen by moving the mouse vertically while the
.I command
button is depressed, releasing the button when the appropriate
selection is highlighted.
.LP
When the mouse is over the background pattern, or at the extreme
left edge of the screen, the
.I command menu 
is activated by the 
mouse.
The
.I command
menu options are:
.TP 12
.B new window
A new window is created by moving the the mouse cursor
(now a box) to the upper left corner of the window, depressing
the
.I command button,
sweeping out the window, then releasing the
.I command button.
The new window, if it is big enough, is started with a shell
running in it.
.TP 12
.B redraw
The background and windows are redrawn.
This is useful if a process unknown to
\*M
scribbles on the display.
It is left to the processing running in a window to fix the contents
of its window.
.TP 12
.B quit
\*M
is terminated, after the
.I quit
is confirmed.
Alternately,
\*M
may be suspended (ala
.B ^Z 
in
.B csh
).
.LP
When the mouse is over the 
.I active
window, the fat bordered window the keyboard is connected to,
the 
.I window menu
is activated by depressing the
.I command button.
The
.I window
menu options are:
.TP 12
.B reshape
.I Reshape
reshapes the 
.I active
window, using a procedure similar to
.I new window
above.
.TP 12
.B stretch
.I Stretch
allows the user to change the shape of the
.I active
window by dragging any corner of the
window to a new location, leaving the opposite corner fixed.
Different server configurations offer either
.I Stretch
or
.I Reshape
on this menu, but not both.
.TP 12
.B move
An outline of the current window
is moved along with the mouse until the
.I command button
is depressed and released.
The current window is then moved to the new location.
.TP 12
.B bury
The current window is made inactive.
Another window (if any) becomes the
.I active
window.
.TP 12
.B cut
The mouse may be used to sweep out and save text from the current window
into a global buffer.  A small scissors appears as the mouse cursor.
Position the upper left corner of the scissors with the upper left
corner of the first character to be saved, then push one of the mouse
buttons, moving the mouse to sweep out the desired text.  Releasing the
button causes the outlined text to be saved.  Using the
.I command button
with 
.I cut
causes the current contents of the global buffer (if any) to be replaced
by the indicated text.  Either of the other two buttons causes the
indicated text to be appended to the global buffer.
.IP
The
.I cut
facility currently works only for windows containing a single font, aligned
on the default character boundaries.  Applications which use only
the terminal emulator sub-set of
.I MGR
capabilities, such as the
.I shell,
.I mail, 
and
.I editors
automatically meet this restriction.  Cuttability may be restored by
issuing a
.I clear
(i.e.\& form feed) to the window.  The window flashes and beeps if the
.I cut
operation could not be completed, usually the result of corrupted data
in the window.  In such cases, no text is saved.  See \*M - C Language
Application Interface for a detailed description of the various
.I cut
option settings.
.TP 12
.B paste
The contents of the global buffer (if any) are inserted into the input
stream of the current window.  The global buffer is filled using 
.B cut
above, or under program control.
.TP 12
.B destroy
All processes associated with the current window are sent a
.I hangup
signal, and the window is destroyed.
.LP
When the mouse is clicked on any window except the
.I active
window, that window moves to the
.I front
and becomes the
.I active 
window.
