The bitblit library is divided into
	very machine-dependent bit blit code, e.g. colorport or linux,
	almost machine-independent code to read and write bitmaps with a
		portable format from a file, i.e. seqbitmap & bitmap,
	and almost machine-independent functions for logging bit blit
		operations, i.e. movie.

These are all the bitblit libraries we are aware of.
Most are of interest mainly for ideas or borrowing code.
Only the Sun and Linux code is still fully integrated, maintained, and tested,
although several other libraries were once production code.

The bitblit.3 manual is only a starting point, the semantics esp. for color
really need to be documented.
