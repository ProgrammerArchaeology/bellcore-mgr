.SH SYNOPSIS
play_data [-x <pels>] [-y <pels>] [-w <pels>] [-h <pels>] [-s <speed>] <script1>

.br
vcr | play_data -v [-x <pels>] [-y <pels>] [-w <pels>] [-h <pels>] | play_audio
2> /dev/null
.SH DESCRIPTION
play_data manages the playback of an $HOME MOVIE video script.
play_data currently runs only on
monochrome Sun Workstations.
.LP
In the first incantation, play_data reads 
.I script
as a file generated by $HOME MOVIE (or stdin if
.I script
is "-") and plays it back on the sun console.
If 
.I script ends in
.B .Z ,
do_data calls
.I zcat
to uncompress it first.
.LP
The command line flags
.I x,y,w,h
specify the portion of the Sun display to use.
.B X
and 
.B y
indicate the origin from the upper left corner, whereas 
.B w
and
.B h
are the width and height in pixels.
The 
.B s
flag specifies the playback speed in percent of normal.
A speed of 200 plays back twice as fast as the default value of 100.
.LP
In the second incantation,  vcr mode,
do_data accepts commands from 
.I vcr
an MGR based driver program.
The
.I x,y,w, 
and
.I h
flags retain their meaning.
The playback speed in controlled through the
.I vcr interface.
Vcr input to play_data consists of one of the following commands:
.TP
S	script
.br
Starts playing the script
.I script.
.TP
s speed
.br
sets the playback speed (in percent).
.TP
P pid
.br
Sets the id of the process to send a hangup
signal when the playback is finished.
.LP
All other commands are written to stdout, to potentially be interpreted
by a downstream filter.
Additional commands are sent to stdout to synchronize and control
.I play_audio
which plays back the audio portion of the $HOME MOVIE script.
These include
.TP
S script
.br
to start a new sound script.
.TP
s speed
.br
to set the audio playback speed
and
.TP
B bytes
.br
to indicate the current byte offset into the audio file.
.LP
If The environment variable
DEBUG
is set, debugging output is spewed onto stderr.
.SH BUGS
.TP
*
play_data is still under development and emits debugging stuff to stderr.
.TP
*
play_data only reads commands (in vcr mode) during pauses in the playback.  If
the playback speed too fast there are no pauses, and no commands are interpreted.
