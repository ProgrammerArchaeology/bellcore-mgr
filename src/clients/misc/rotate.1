.SH NAME
rotate \- Rotate a bitmap 90 degrees.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Rotate
[ \fB\-w wide \-h high\fP ]
[ \fB\-x\fP ]
[ \fB\-v\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Rotate
is a filter that rotates a 1 bit deep bitmap clockwise by 90 degrees.
Normally
.B rotate
expects a bitmap in 
.I mgr
format which uses a bitmap header to specify the width and height.
Alternately, the
.B -w
and
.B -h
flags may be used to indicate the bitmap 
.I width
and
.I height
if no bitmap header is present.
If 
.B -x
is specified, no bitmap header will be produced for the resultant
bitmap.
The 
.B -v
flags prints 
.B <'s
and
.B >'s
to help stave off boredom while
.B rotate
is running.
.SH BUGS
.B Rotate
can't currently rotate bitmaps with more than 1200 rows.
