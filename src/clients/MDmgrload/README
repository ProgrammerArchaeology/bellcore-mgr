Mgrload is a quick little program I wrote to imitate the function provided
by xload, the X windows load average monitor.  Full details of what mgrload
does can be found in the mgrload man page, however, be aware that mgrload
requires the loadavgd daemon to be running in the background, so remember
to start it (via root) before running mgrload.  As usual, bug reports/
ehancements/kudos/equipment/money :-) can be either posted to unix-pc.*, 
comp.sys.att or sent to directly to me.
