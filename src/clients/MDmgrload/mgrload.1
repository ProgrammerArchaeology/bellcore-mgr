.SH NAME
mgrload -\ Graph of system load average
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mgrload
[\fB\-x\fP<pos>]
[\fB\-y\fP<pos>]
[\fB\-l\fP<pixels>]
[\fB\-w\fP<pixels>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mgrload
uses the
.I loadavgd
daemon to extract information from the kernel to determine the current cpu
load.  The load is represented as a floating point number
greater than or equal to zero and represents the average number of processes
which were on the run queue during the past 60 seconds.
.I Mgrload 
represents this data as a scrolling bar graph with each bar
representing the load during a 60 second interval.  The vertical scale of
the graph is dynamically adjusted to account for changing load average
values.  Horizontal lines are placed on the graph spaced at a value
of 0.50 apart.  Precise values for the displayed maximum, minimum and most
recent load value can be shown using the menu available when the right
mouse button is pressed.  System information such as the host name is
available by pressing the middle mouse button.  This information can be
useful when
.I mgrload
is run in a networked environment and several
.I mgrloads
are running to display load averages of remote systems.
Additional funtions such as redrawing the graph and resetting all stored
values are also available by pressing the right mouse button.
.LP
.B mgrload
recognizes the following command line flags:
.TP 
-x<pos>
Starting x-coordinate of graph
.TP 
-y<pos>
Starting y-coordinate of graph
.TP 
-l<pixels>
Length of graph in pixels
.TP 
-w<pixels>
Width of graph in pixels
.SH BUGS
If the shared memory segment which
.I loadavgd
creates is removed,
.I mgrload
will crash with a bus error.
.LP
Killing
.I loadavgd
is a bad thing to do.
