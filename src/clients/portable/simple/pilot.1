.SH NAME
pilot \- A bitmap browser for MGR
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pilot
[-r]
\fBfilename\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Pilot displays the MGR bitmap in 
.I filename
on the current window, and permits the user to pan the image around the window.
The characters h,j,k and l move the image left, down, up, and right
respectively. H,J,K, and L move the image as before, only twice as far.
The remaining keys, +, -, R, ?, W and q
change the movement increment (up or down), redraw the image, display help, 
write the current window image in 
.I bitmap.out
and quit, respectively.
.LP
The -r flag causes the image to be displayed inverted.
.SH BUGS
.TP 
*
The image file is read from the same host
.I MGR
is executing on, not the host 
.I pilot is running on.
