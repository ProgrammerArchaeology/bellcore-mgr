My first implementation tried to be clean and used the MGR server and
the Hershey font functions from libmgr.  It was clean, but awful slow.
This implementation is a few hundred times faster.  It doesn't use the
server or even the MGR bitblit library at all, so it being portable is
not an issue.  It does however use some code from graph_subs.c in the
MGR server, written by Stephen A. Uhler.

The driver isn't finished yet, arcs and splines are missing yet.  The
created pbm files can be printed with pbmtoprt, written by Guido Muesch,
see the SUPPORT file.

Special characters not not completely supported and font remounting is
not supported at all.

ISO support is restricted to ƒд÷ц№ья and quite a hack, but it works.

The driver relies on getting correct input files.  I didn't have the
time to make error checks because I *needed* it very much when I wrote
it at first.
