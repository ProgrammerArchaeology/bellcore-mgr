.SH NAME
C_MENU \- Turn 
.B C
error messages into 
.B vi
menus.
.SH SYNOPSIS
make -k | c_menu; vi
.SH DESCRIPTION
C_menu
reads its standard input and looks for lines of the form:
.RS
"foo.c", line 19: word undefined.
.RE
All such lines are gathered into a set of menus, one for each 
.B C
file, that are useful for locating the errors in the source files using
the
.I vi
edittor.
.LP
The main menu contains the names of the 
.B C
files with errors, selecting a file causes that file to be editted.
Sliding off to the right of the
.I "file name"
menu
pops up a list of error messages.
Selecting an error message while in 
.I vi
causes 
.I vi
to move its cursor to the line containing the error.
.LP
The most common way to use 
.I c_menu
is with the
.B MGR
.I cut
and
.I paste
facility.
After running a
.I make
or
.I cc
that produces 
.B C
error messages,
simply 
.I cut
the error messages, type
.B c_menu;vi ,
.I paste
the errors into
.I c_menu ,
then key
.I CNTL d.
.SH SEE ALSO
mgr(1L)
menu(1L)
.SH BUGS
After adding or deleting lines from the file,
.I c_menu 's
notion of which line contains the error is incorrect.
