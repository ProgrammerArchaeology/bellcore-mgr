This is an updated release of PGS a postscript previewer for MGR
PGS uses Ghostscript for its postscript interpreter.

PGS was written by Stephen Uhler, but updated by Vincent Broman.
The Alladin ghostscript version 3.0 has mgr support built-in and
does not need patching to run under pgs.  Look on ftp.cs.wisc.edu.

Installation instructions:
  * obtain Ghostscript release 2.6.1.4 from your favorite GNU archive.
    (try gatekeeper.dec.com for starters).

  * apply the diffs contained in "gs.patch.2614mono" to add support
    for the MGR device.
    (cd to the gs2.4.1 distriburion, and run: "patch < gs.patch.2614mono")

  * Build a new "gs" with the MGR driver.  Make sure you also include any
    other drivers required for your system (the MGR driver needn't be first).
    Install the new "gs" somewhere in your PATH.

  * Build pgs.  You will need the MGR client library "libmgr.a" and
    "include/mgr/mgr.h" supplied with the MGR distribution.
    You may need to change the first few lines of the Makefile to find them.
    run "make".

  * copy pgs and pgs.1 to the appropriate places.
