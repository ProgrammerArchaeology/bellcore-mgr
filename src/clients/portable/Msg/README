This directory contains a sample client-server system.  It uses menus
to traverse the file system, and servers to do things to selected files.

* do		runs a unix command as a server
* start		calls do with a bunch of canned servers
* client		monitors communications, and is a prototype for clients
* alias		is a CSH alias that lets the shell send messages to the servers
                via mgr menus
* send		sends a message to a server
* menus		downloads menus into mgr for use with send and do

USAGE
-----

1) type make (makes do,client,menus,send and alias)
   - make sure LIB and INCL in Makefile are correct
2) make sure you are running mgr (and it is suid to root)
3) switch to csh (or convert alias to your favorite shell equivalent)
4) source alias
5) start up some clients (using start) - try "start more"
   - open a new window and change to this directory
   - cat start for some examples
   - make sure the appropriate icons are in .../icon
   
6) type "cd ." to start things off.
7) use the menu (button 2) to select a file, then
   use button 1 to pick a server
