Here are some simple command scripts for MTX
Sorry, there is no documentation (yet) for the command language

grep rexp
	insert grep filter between last created process and window
	Grep is a shell script wrapper for grep (included)

tap  rexp
	add a tap onto the last process

split
	make a process with 2 windows
