This is a simple multiwindow multiplexor for MGR.
It permits the creation and manipulation of multiple shells and windows using
only one MGR connection.  This is useful when only one connection is avaliable,
as is the case for dialup lines.

Each window emulates (suprise) an MGR window, with a few exceptions.
Currently and alternate window creation and M_DUPKEY mode are not
supported, although this limitation may be lifted in the future.

The simplest way to use MTX is as follows.
- Start MGR and create a window.
- Using tip, kermit, or cu, make a connection to a remote machine.
- Start MTX on the remote machine (remote doesn't have to be able to run MGR)
- Select "make a window" from the MTX main menu several times
- Each of the windows has a shell on the remote machine, the connections
  are multiplexed over the single serial line.
