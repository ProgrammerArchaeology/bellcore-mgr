This is a quick little program to convert UNIXpc font(4) files (like
those found in /usr/lib/wfont) to MGR font(5) files.  I'm not
entirely sure why you might want to do this, but I must have had a
reason when I started...

Usage is:
	ft2fnt ft_file > fnt_file

where ft_file is a font(4) file and fnt_file is a font(5) file.
(No, it can't read stdin; it wants to get the size, and I was too
lazy to blow stdin to a temp file.)

Since the UNIXpc font format allows characters to ``overlap'', and
the MGR format doesn't, ft2fnt has to make larger character rasters
than the original for some fonts, eg. /usr/lib/wfont/FANCY.I.E.24.A.
This causes the font to look wider-spaced under MGR.  You win a few,
you lose a few.

Yes, it could have a prettier usage, but how often you plan on
running it?  Yes, it could be faster, but how often do you plan on
running it?

There are no distribution restrictions; it's completely public
domain.  I would appreciate it if you kept my name attached, and
attached yours if you make changes so we don't get blamed for each
other's bugs.

And of course I'd like to hear about any bugs, enhancements, etc.
