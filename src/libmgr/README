This is the library to link MGR clients with.  The functions for Hershey
fonts are not related to client/server protocol.  I removed the old
Hershey support, no client used it and I needed better functions for my
clients.

In hfont_printto, x and y are coordinates shifted by 7 bit left.  I use
that as kind of a fix point arithmetic to reduce scaling errors.
