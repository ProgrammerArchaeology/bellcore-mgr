bug fixes for patch-2

* Add current fg, bg, and drawing color to M_GETINFO
* M_MAKEWIN with M_DUPKEY doesn't return M_DUP character properly
* change all m_pop(0) to m_pop() in all demos
* Apply cut.c fix to figure cuttability properly
* Add m_setcursor(), %M, and button-up stuff to documentation
* Makefile for doc/usrman fixed (again)
* m_line() should update graphics point
* _quit() should killpg() and b_destroy(screen) (for non-sun versions)
* pixrect on sun 4.0 changed the internal alignment to 32 bits from 16 bits
* missing "extern" for quit_menu[] in defs.h
* mgrplot plots upside-down
* set_{emacs,termcap} look for SHELL "*csh" instead of "csh" (so tcsh works)
* timestamps avaliable for button hits (clients can detect double-clicking)
* Stub bit-blit library included. (to aid in porting mgr)
* m_push(P_CURSOR) handles the cursor style properly
* loadfont: definition of ESC was wrong
* get_info.c - didn't initialize *coords with no dupkey set
* fix set_emacs to set "km" flag for gnu-emacs
* move "resume" command after kbd reset to permit set_console as resume cmd
* Application defined button activated text sweep  defaults to 0 chars (was 1)
* Fix get_info to return a \n for an invalid get_info request
* Fix win_stack to clear DUPKEY when push-clear'ing flags
* don't use return value from sprintf in do_event.c
* show uses bitmaphead, to handle all types of bitmap formats correctly
* iconmail/iconmsgs now remember if their mail/msgs window was moved
* All versions of MGR use a consolidated 32bit padded font format
* Bug in clipping relative mode bitmapes was fixed

Known bugs still remaining
* put_window() sometimes sets the clipping regeon improperly during
  bit-blt operations (i.e. obscured windows don't always get updated
  properly).
* There is no way to push the currently selected window on the stack
