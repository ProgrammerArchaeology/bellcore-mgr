MGR, version 0.53 for Linux and SunOS (Coherent unfinished yet).
Linux 0.99.2 and GCC 2.3.3.  Much by M Haardt.

MGR now compiles even with -DMOVIE, but it crashes at start.  Logging
itself however works now, and the log created by lines can be replayed
using play_data.  Look at the test directory in libbitblit and at
play_data in clients.  I decided to use machine dependent log files for
now because bitmaps are machine dependent anyway.
You also see that problem when uploading bitmaps to the server, they are
not in independent extern format ... :(

The new portable sun bitblit library almost works now, there only seems
to be a problem with line drawing.  To see it, compile it, link the MGR
server with sunport and start a big clock.
