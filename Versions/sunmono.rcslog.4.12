moved files to conform to names of functions...
bitmap -> sun
blit -> bit_blit
fast_scroll -> bit_bytescroll
line -> bit_line
pixel -> bit_point
rops -> test_randops
dummy.c subsumed into sun.c
bit_destroy.c new from part of bitmap.c

Conform Makefile to expectations of superior Makefiles and to new names.
#include screen.h not sun.h .
lint bit_blit and fix the "src_map==BIT_NULL;" bug.
lint bit_bytescroll
sun.c and bit_on.c stripped down from the colorport code.
sun.h adds prototypes.

This versions lacks a flip() function and ignores the fg/bg
colors encoded into the bitops.
