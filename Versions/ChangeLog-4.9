MGR, version 0.58 beta for Linux and SunOS (Coherent unfinished yet).

Bradley Bosch fixed some more warnings by adding prototypes and made the
following extensions to the server (with minimal amount of new code :).

The cut changes allow visible text from any window to be cut instead of
just the top window.

Cut() has also been extended to allow fast single operation cut/paste of
words from anyplace on the screen to the current window.  This is
currently bound to alt-x.  To see how this works, configure Linux to
generate the meta bit for alt and position the mouse over a word you
want to type and press alt-x.  This is very handy for copying shell
command arguments from ls output, etc.  The code for the word copy was
first done by Andrew Morton (applix@runxtsa.runx.oz.au last time he
knew) but got rewritten it a bit since then.

The window placement for windows created with alt-n (and other cases
which use default location) has been changed to:

-  Adjust default position depending on screen size and window number.
-  Leave a bit of room on bottom for closed windows.
-  Ensure that the window will fit on the screen.

The old code tended to create truncated windows as more windows were
created on a small screen.

The old code to transfer bitmaps to the server is removed now, after it
was outcommented last time already.  All applications used the portable
format in 0.58 alpha already and no problems were found.

I started looking at libmgr, and provided some new interfaces which are
easier to use than the existing functions.

MGR knows a new mode, M_CONSOLE.  Only one window can have it at a time,
setting it in one window clears it in all others.  If TIOCCONS is
defined for the system, MGR will redirect console output to the window
with the mode set.  Clearing the mode will disable redirection.  This
makes set_console obsolete, so if no problems appear, I will delete it
in the next release.  Use "mgrmode setmode console" instead.

A silly bug in the copyright() function is fixed now, so the globe spins
with a defined speed, not as fast as the machine allows.

There is active work done on improving the library,
like thinking about a better way to deal with events and
getting a toolkit manager to work.

Zeyd Ben Halim for lots of helpful patches,
especially the adaption of selection.
Bradley Bosch <brad@lachman.com> for lots of patches from his 3b1 port,
which fix bugs and implement new and desirable features.
Andrew Morton (applix@runxtsa.runx.oz.au) who first wrote the cut-word code.
