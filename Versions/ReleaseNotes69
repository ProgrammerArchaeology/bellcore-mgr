Mgr version 0.69

FreeBSD port of Tim Pierce combined with linux code and
a few ifdefs, not retested by Pierce, yet.

Screen saver and locker (using your login password)
built in to the server, on the quit menu.

Fixes to the pilot image viewer.

The bitblit treatment of color inversions is more consistent.
